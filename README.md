Our Canon LBP622c printer keeps changing its AirPlay name, which makes the
printer hard to find on computers that use the name to find the printer.

This script, recorded using Chrome Recorder, navigates to the printer at
http://192.168.86.80 and sets the printer name to a hardcoded value.

Setup: `bin/setup`

Usage: `bin/run`
